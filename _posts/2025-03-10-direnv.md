Small application, direnv, is very convenient.  You can set it up, then add .envrc to each directory to save time to export required variables manually.  
```bash
# install bash, since the default shell in Alpine is NOT bach
apk add bash

# change the user shell from sh to bash in /etc/passwd file
root:x:0:0:root:/root:/bin/bash

# install direnv binary
curl -sfL https://direnv.net/install.sh | bash

# add this line in .profile
eval "$(direnv hook bash)"

```

Add .envrc to any directory which need to set the environment up.  
sample of this like:  
```bash
#!/bin/bash

git config user.email "daqin_pan@yahoo.com"
git config user.name "panyu101"

```
